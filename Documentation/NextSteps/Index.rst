Next steps
----------

Armed with this basic knowledge of TypoScript, you may want
to continue your exploration of TYPO3 CMS by following the
:ref:`Templating Tutorial <t3templating:start>`, which will
guide you through the creation of a whole web site template
using TypoScript.

To learn more about the structure and syntax of TypoScript,
you can refer to the :ref:`TypoScript Syntax and In-depth Study <t3coreapi:typoscript-syntax-start>`
reference.

Finally - as was mentioned again and again throughout this tutorial -
the ultimate resource about TypoScript objects, functions and
data types is the :ref:`TypoScript Reference <t3tsref:start>`.
