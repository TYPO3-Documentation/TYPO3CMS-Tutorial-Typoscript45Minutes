Further objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :ref:`CASE <t3tsref:cobj-case>` allows case differentiation. In
  "css\_styled\_content", this object is used for rendering different
  objects according to their type.

- :ref:`COA <t3tsref:cobj-coa>` (content object array) allows us to
  combine an arbitrary number of objects.

- :ref:`COA\_INT <t3tsref:cobj-coa-int>` is a COA object, but non-cached.
  This element will be regenerated upon each call. This is useful
  with time and date or user-dependent data, for example.

- :ref:`LOAD\_REGISTER <t3tsref:cobj-load-register>` /
  :ref:`RESTORE\_REGISTER <t3tsref:cobj-restore-register>`
  objects allow us to fill the global array :code:`$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register[]`
  with content. These objects return nothing. Single values and complete
  TypoScript objects can be used. In doing so, the register works as a
  stack: With every call, a further element is stacked. With
  :code:`RESTORE_REGISTER`, the element on top can be removed.
  Values in the register can be used with the
  :ref:`getText <t3tsref:data-type-gettext-register>` data type.

- :ref:`USER <t3tsref:cobj-user>` and USER\_INT are for user-defined
  functions. Every frontend plugin from a TYPO3 CMS extension is such an object.
  :ref:`USER\_INT <t3tsref:cobj-user-int>` is the non-cached variant.

- :ref:`IMG\_RESOURCE <t3tsref:cobj-img-resource>` is used by the
  :ref:`IMAGE <t3tsref:cobj-image>` object. The resource returned is
  normally the :code:`src` attribute of the :code:`<img>` tag.
  If images are scaled, this object serves as
  a calculation basis for the new files, which are stored in the
  :file:`_processed_` folder of each file storage.

- :ref:`GIFBUILDER <t3tsref:gifbuilder>` is used for generating image
  files dynamically. Various texts and images can be combined, and much
  more.
