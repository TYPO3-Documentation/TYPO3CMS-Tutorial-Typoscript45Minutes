==================
TypoScript objects
==================

As we already saw there is quite a variety of TypoScript objects. Each object
has a number of properties. These can be simple data types or functions, which
have their own set of properties. Using properties that don't exist will have

The :ref:`TypoScript Reference <t3tsref:start>` lists all data types, functions
and objects with their properties. This chapter offers a short overview of the
most common objects to give you an idea of what is available.
