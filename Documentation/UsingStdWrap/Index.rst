Using stdWrap correctly
-----------------------

The :ref:`stdWrap <t3tsref:stdwrap>` function is one of the most powerful
and most widely used of all TypoScript. Most properties actually support
:code:`stdWrap` turning each of them into some kind of Swiss army knife.

:code:`stdWrap` is very rich, having itself a large number of
properties. This chapter is intended to give you a feel you
:code:`stdWrap` so that you may get familiar with it and be
ready to explore it in greater depth using the
:ref:`TypoScript Reference <t3tsref:stdwrap>`.
