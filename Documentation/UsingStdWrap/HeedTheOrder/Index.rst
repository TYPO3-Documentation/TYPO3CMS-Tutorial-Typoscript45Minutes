.. _stdwrap-order:

Heed the order
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The single most important thing to know about :code:`stdWrap`
is that all properties are parsed/executed exactly in the order
in which they appear in the :ref:`TypoScript Reference <t3tsref:stdwrap>`,
no matter in which order you have set them in your TypoScript
template.

Let's consider this example:

.. code-block:: typoscript

	10 = TEXT
	10.value = typo3
	10.noTrimWrap = |<strong>Tool: |</strong>|
	10.case = upper

It results in the following:

.. code-block:: html

    <strong>Tool: TYPO3</strong>

The :code:`case` property is executed before the :code:`wrap`
property. Hence only "typo3" was changed to uppercase and
not the "Tool:" with which it is wrapped.
